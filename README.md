**SPAM CLASSIFIER** 



In this hands-on project, I built an AI-based spam detection system using real-world text message data. The goal was to apply natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to automatically identify and classify spam messages. 

Spam messages are unsolicited communications that interrupt users and may introduce security risks. Reliable spam detection is important for email services, messaging applications, and mobile networks to ensure a safe and trustworthy user experience.

The main objective of this project is to develop a classification model capable of distinguishing spam from legitimate (ham) messages. Using a labeled dataset, I analyzed linguistic and structural patterns commonly associated with spam. The workflow includes data cleaning, NLP-based feature extraction, and training machine learning models for classification.

Starting from raw text, the project follows a structured pipeline that gradually leads to building and improving an effective spam classifier.

Key Steps

During this project, I:

Cleaned and preprocessed text data using NLP techniques.

Performed tokenization and extracted features using methods such as TF-IDF.

Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models for message classification.

Explored strategies to minimize false positives and false negatives to improve model performance.
